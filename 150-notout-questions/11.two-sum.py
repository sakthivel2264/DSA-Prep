# Two Integer Sum II â€“ Medium Level Problem
# You are given a sorted array of integers called numbers, arranged in non-decreasing order. Your task is to find two numbers in the array that add up to a given value called targets.

# You need to return the positions of these two numbers as a list, [index1, index2], using 1-based indexing (the first element of the array is at position 1). The following conditions must be met:

# The two indices, index1 and index2, must be different.
# The value at index1 should appear before the value at index2 in the array.
# There is exactly one correct solution for this problem. Your solution should use constant extra space (O(1)).


def twoSum(numbers, target):
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1

        while l < r:
            curSum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]

            if curSum > target:
                r -= 1
            elif curSum < target:
                l += 1
            else:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]
        return []
    
numbers = [2,7,11,15]

print(twoSum(numbers, 13))
