# Container with Most Water â€“ Hard Level Problem
# You are given an array heights, where each element heights[i] represents the height of a vertical bar at position i. Your task is to select any two bars to form a container, with the width of the container being the distance between the two bars.

# The goal is to find the maximum amount of water that this container can hold. Return the largest possible value of water that can be stored.

# Example 1
# Input: height = [1,7,2,5,4,7,3,6]
# Output: 36
# Example 2
# Input: height = [2,2,2]
# Output: 4

        max_area = max(max_area, area)
        if nums[l] < nums[r]:
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
        
    return max_area
